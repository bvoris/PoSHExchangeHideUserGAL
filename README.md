# PoSHExchangeHideUserGAL
Works with Exchange 2010 and 2013  Running this script will bring up a GUI in which you can input a specific user to hide that users mailbox. 
<BR />
This script will run remotely from your desktop and only requires you to change the name to your exchange server name.  <BR />
You will enter your admin credentials and remotely log onto the exchange server.  <BR />
I specifically used this script for terminated employees, to hide them in the Global Address List... <BR />  
This also requires powershell 4.0 in order to run.

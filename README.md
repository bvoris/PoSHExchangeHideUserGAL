# PoSHExchangeHideUserGAL
Works with Exchange 2010 and 2013  Running this script will bring up a GUI in which you can input a specific user to hide that users mailbox.  This script will run remotely from your desktop and only requires you to change the name to your exchange server name.  You will enter your admin credentials and remotely log onto the exchange server.  I specifically used this script for terminated employees, to hide them in the Global Address List..  This also requires powershell 4.0 in order to run.
